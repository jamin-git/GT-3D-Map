# Re-Imagine Georgia Tech

<br>

## Synposis / Description
The goal of the Re-Imagine Georgia Tech project is to prompt the audience to reimagine what it means to be a Tech student. This project utilizes the VQGAN+CLIP? AI to create visual representations of Georgia Tech landmarks. These representations give insight into what connotations students hold with the university. It prompts users to imagine if these associations are intended or if they develop over time. It also aims to provide an artistic medium for students to reimagine what these buildings/landmarks could represent in the future. I also hope that this form of generative art could be applied in other facets of life as well. The idea of reimaging your surroundings allows for different perspectives and or different ideas about how society operates as a whole. This imagination is an important factor in bringing about real change within the world.
